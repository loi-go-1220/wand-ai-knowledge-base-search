**Wand AI Backend Engineer — Technical Challenge 

  
Overview  
We’re an AI company building systems that let enterprises use AI as part of their workforce in the hybrid workforce model.  
You will complete one of the following challenges solo in 24 hours, focusing on your specialty.  
You should treat this like a real-world scenario: requirements are high-level, trade-offs must be made, and you are responsible for design, implementation, and documentation.

### Challenge 1: Multi-Agent Task Solver

Backend Engineer  
Implement the agent orchestration layer:

- Each agent runs in isolation but can pass results to others.  
      
    
- Handle concurrency, retries, and timeouts.  
      
    
- Enable pluggable tools (e.g., data fetcher, chart generator).  
      
    
- Provide a clear API for frontend consumption.  
      
    

High Marks: Modular architecture allowing dynamic agent creation and execution graph.

### Challenge 2: AI-Powered Knowledge Base Search & Enrichment

Backend Engineer  
Implement:

- Document ingestion pipeline (store raw + vector embeddings).  
      
    
- Semantic search service.  
      
    
- API for Q&A and completeness check.  
      
    

Ensure efficiency for queries across thousands of documents.

High Marks: Indexing pipeline supports incremental updates and handles large file sizes.
