# AI-Powered Knowledge Base Search & Enrichment

> **Status**: ðŸš§ In Development - Technical Assessment Project
> 
> **Timeline**: 24 hours
> 
> **Challenge**: Wand AI Backend Engineer Assessment - Challenge 2

## Quick Overview

Building an AI-powered knowledge base system with:
- Document ingestion with OpenAI embeddings
- Semantic search capabilities
- Q&A system using retrieved context
- Efficient handling of large document collections

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI API (embeddings + GPT-4)
- **Vector Storage**: TBD (likely in-memory for MVP)
- **Database**: SQLite (for metadata)

## Setup (WIP)

```bash
# TODO: Add proper setup instructions once structure is finalized
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Development Notes

This is a 24-hour technical assessment. Expect:
- Rapid prototyping and iteration
- Trade-offs for time constraints
- Focus on core functionality over polish
- Real development process with messy commits
