Cloud Computing Essentials

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

Service Models

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Examples include Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.

Platform as a Service (PaaS): Offers hardware and software tools over the internet, typically for application development. Examples include Google App Engine, Heroku, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis. Examples include Gmail, Salesforce, and Microsoft Office 365.

Deployment Models

Public Cloud: Services offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them.

Private Cloud: Computing services offered either over the internet or a private internal network to select users instead of the general public.

Hybrid Cloud: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

Benefits of Cloud Computing

Cost Savings: Eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software
Scalability: Easy to scale up or down based on demand
Flexibility: Access services from anywhere with an internet connection
Reliability: Data backup and disaster recovery are easier and less expensive
Security: Cloud providers offer many security features and policies

Challenges include data security concerns, potential downtime, and vendor lock-in issues.
